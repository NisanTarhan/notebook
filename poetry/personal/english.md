#### ambulance

```
2016
my body is in this ambulance
crossing the pacific ocean once again
just to recover from a brutal february
spent mostly committing crimes

another cliff I jumped off yesterday
was deciding to not get high this morning
in the only way of staying awake
I ended up in this ambulance
```

#### your shoes

```
2016

birds are known for being a warm blanket
and growing words upon the mountains
where I asked the wind is tired today
thinking if your shoes were untied there

glaciers are known for having cracks in their lips
and growing uprisings in mesapotamia valleys
where I asked the sun to stay with me
thinking if your shoes would untie somewhere
```
