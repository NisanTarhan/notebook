# Love and Education

* To love someone is, according to Romantic philosophy, quite simply to love them as they are, without any wish to alter them.
* What do we do with what we perceive as their weaknesses, the problems and regrettable aspects? The Greek idea of love turns to a notion to which we desperately need to rehabilitate ourselves: education. For the Greeks, given the scale of our imperfections, part of what it means to deepen love is to want to teach—and to be ready to be taught. Two people should see a relationship as a constant opportunity to improve and be improved. When lovers teach each other uncomfortable truths, they are not abandoning the spirit of love. They are trying to do something very true to genuine love, which is to make their partners more worthy of admiration.
* We should stop feeling guilty for simply wanting to change our partners and we should never resent our partners for simply wanting to change us.
* The good teacher knows that timing is critical to successful instruction. We tend automatically to try to teach a lesson the moment the problem arises, rather than when it is most likely to be attended to (which might be several days later).
* And so we typically end up addressing the most delicate and complex teaching tasks just at the point when we feel most scared and distressed and our student is most exhausted and nervous.
* When teaching and learning fail, we enter the realm of nagging.
* Lamentably, it doesn’t work. Nagging breeds its evil twin, shirking. The other pretends to read the paper, goes upstairs and feels righteous.
* The solution to nagging isn’t to give up trying to get others to do what we want. Rather, it is to recognize that persuasion always needs to be couched in terms that make intuitive sense to those we want to alter.
