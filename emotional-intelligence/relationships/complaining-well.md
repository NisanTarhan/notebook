# Complaining well

* Complaining well requires an impression that not everything depends on the complaint being heard perfectly. Were the lesson to go wrong, were the other to prove intransigent, one could survive and take one's love elsewhere. Not everything is at stake in an argument.
* To guide us in our restorative complaints, we might consider the following range of prompts:

* I sometimes feel frustrated with you when ...
* I’d love you to realize that you hurt me when ...
* One of the hardest things for you to understand about me is ...
* What I’d love you to appreciate about me is ...
* Where I’m unfulfilled in my life ...
