# Fear of rejection

* The assumption is that the terror of rejection will be limited in scope and focused on one particular stage of a relationship: its beginning. Once a partner is finally accepted and the union gets under way, the assumption is that the fear must come to an end.
* But one of the odder features of relationships is that, in truth, the fear of rejection never ends. It continues, even in quite sane people, on a daily basis, with frequently difficult consequences—chiefly because we refuse to pay it sufficient attention and aren’t trained to spot its counter-intuitive symptoms in others. We haven’t found a winning way to keep admitting just how much reassurance we need.
* Within established relationships, when the fear of rejection is denied, two major symptoms tend to show up.
* First, we may become distant—or what psychotherapists call “avoidant.”
* We grow into avoidant patterns when, in childhood, attempts at closeness ended in degrees of rejection, humiliation, uncertainty, or shame that we were ill-equipped to deal with.
* Or else we become controlling—or what psychotherapists calls “anxious.” We grow suspicious, frantic, and easily furious in the face of the ambiguous moments of love; catastrophe never feels too far away.
