# Affairs

* An affair is a love—or sexual—story between two people, one of whom (at least) is ostensibly committed to someone else.
* Once an affair has been uncovered, we often ask—in the position of the betrayed, pained party—when it began. Pinpointing the precise moment promises to shed light on its motivations and on possible ways to prevent any further such calamities in the future.
* This kind of detective work feels obvious, but it overlooks a complexity: The start of an affair should not be equated with the moment when two straying people meet.
* The affair pre-dates, possibly by many years, the arrival of any actual lover.

#### Signs of heading to affairs:

* Unending busy-ness
* Neglect
* Shaming
* Ownership
* Flirting
* One too many arguments
* Lack of tenderness
* Erotic disengagement

## How to Spot a Couple Who Might be Headed for an Affair

* Having arguments does not, in itself, say very much about the likelihood of a relationship disintegrating.
* A number of qualities are required to ensure that a couple know how to argue well. There is, first and foremost, the need for each party to be able to pinpoint sources of discomfort in themselves early and accurately: to know how to recognize what they are unhappy about and what they need in order to flourish in the couple.

**Over-optimism about relationships**

**Being out of touch with pain**

* Fragile couples tend not to be good detectives with regard to their own sufferings. They may be both unhappy and yet unsure as to the actual causes of their dissatisfactions. They know something is wrong in their union, but they can’t easily trace the catalyst.

**Shame**

* A shamed person has fundamental doubts about their right to exist: Somewhere in the past, they have been imbued with the impression that they do not matter very much, that their feelings should be ignored, that their happiness is not a priority, that their words do not count.
* Once they are part of a couple, shamed people hurt like anyone else, but their capacity to turn their hurt into something another person can understand and be touched by is recklessly weak.
* Shamed people will sulk rather than speak, hide rather than divulge, feel secretly wretched rather than candidly complain. It is frequently very late, far too late, by the time shamed people finally let their lover know more about the nature of their desperation.

**Excessive Anxiety**

* Complaining well requires an impression that not everything depends on the complaint being heard perfectly. Were the lesson to go wrong, were the other to prove intransigent, one could survive and take one's love elsewhere.

**Hopelessness about dialog**

**The Role of Sex in Affairs**

* Why is sex so nice? One possible answer, which can sound a little odd, is: because we have advanced tendencies to hate ourselves and find ourselves unacceptable. And sex with a new person has an exceptional capacity to reduce feeling like that.
* A long-term relationship can all too easily enforce a sense that we are neither very admirable nor worthy. Management of family life, of cleaning rotas, of finances, and of relations with friends and in-laws can contribute to an impression that one is fundamentally troublesome and undeserving of sustained notice. The mood around us is fractious and ungrateful. "Not you again** may be the implicit message one receives upon entering any room.
* In the context of an affair, everything changes. We can be unlaced and carefree.
* What we may be doing is slipping off another’s top or inviting them to release our trousers, but what all this means is that another human has -exceptionally- chosen to find us worthy.
* The crucial, active element in an affair isn’t really the physical sex per se: it’s the sense of closeness, the warmth, the shared liking for which physical sex provides the occasion.
